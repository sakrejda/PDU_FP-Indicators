Family planning indicators by marital status and age from MICS and DHS micro-data sets

This repository contains tools for harmonising relevant variables and calculating family planning indicators by marital status and age from MICS and DHS micro-data sets. These tools were developed as part of the 'Making Family Planning Count' project by the UN Population Division and financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

If you detect a bug or have a suggestion please notify us using the Issues tab on github.

Note: MICS (http://mics.unicef.org/) and DHS (https://www.dhsprogram.com/) micro-data sets need to be obtained from the providers in order to use the tools.
